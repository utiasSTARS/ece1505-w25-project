\section{Conclusion and Discussion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this project, we explored the use of the Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) framework for motion planning in high-dimensional dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks. By formulating the planning problem as a mixed-integer convex program (MICP), we demonstrated that feasible and near-optimal trajectories can be generated even in complex and cluttered environments.

While GCS requires greater setup effort and computational resources, it offers free certificates of optimality for complex motion planning tasks. This provides valuable insight into solution quality and serves as a theoretical benchmark for evaluating performance. We also show that careful selection of convex, collision-free regions has a significant impact on both the solution quality and runtime of the algorithm. This suggests promising directions for future work in exploring alternative approaches for handling an increasing number of convex sets. Overall, convex optimization-based motion planning proves to be a powerful tool for planning in complex environments---particularly when solution quality and theoretical guarantees are prioritized.
