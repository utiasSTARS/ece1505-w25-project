\section{Problem Formulation}

\subsection{Notation}
All the notations used throughout this report

\subsection{Problem statement}
Formulate our problem here (minimization of path length for example)

\subsection{IRIS}
optional, but could provide brief description of IRIS (including some equations) and how we use it

\subsection{Optimization problem}

brief GCS (nodes from IRIS and edges) --- note, we could have separate section for GCS too if it is too long, Mixed-Integer Formulation, final mathematical statement of our optimization problem
